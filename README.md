Teh Vertices on crease patterns can become too inaccurate to fold with Oriedita by using Oripa originally or excessive moving/copypasting in Orihime/Oriedita.
This little program fixes the ones that lie on any grid. It can't fix vertices that use 22.5 angle references. 

The current version might not fully work with projects, that have wild combinations of grid sizes (partials and multiples of 3 (6, 12) and maybe 5 (10, 20) should work, but for something like 63 and 50 it will only find the one that has more verticecs).

Versions v1.3 and older have a manual input for the grid size, so you can use one of those, if that ever comes up.
